# Universal Business Framework (UBF)

The UBF aids in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Mergers and Acquisitions (M and A), and large-scale project management. It views industries, businesses, and their connections in a relational and structural perspective.

The UBF helps understand, predict, and direct large decisions across entire industries. It aids in navigating multiple projects and organizations simultaneously and provides real-time outcomes of dynamic decisions.

The UBF maps and observes S.T.A.R.s along their due course while aiding them in navigating obstacles. It has a defined classification system to understand the structure and dynamics of galaxies, aiding in informed decisions about companies, ideas, and investments. It is used by organizations that have adopted SWARM Intelligence, Agile Methodology, and DROID Ops.
