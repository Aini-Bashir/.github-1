# Universal Business Framework (UBF)
The UBF aids organizations who consult in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Mergers and Acquistitions (M and A) and helps plan large scale project management. This framework views industries, the businesses inside of them, and all their connections in the same fashion we understand the universe from a relational and structural perspective.
<br><br>
Those who study the UBF can have confidence in understanding, predicting, and even directing large decisions across entire industries. It also helps navigating multiple projects and multiple organizations simultaneously to understand the outcome of dynamic decisions on a real-time basis.
<br><br>
The UBF maps and observes S.T.A.R.s along their due course while aiding them in navigating obstacles in a defined manner. The UBF has a defined classification system to easily understand the structure and dynamics of the galaxies within which aid in making informed decisions about companies, ideas, and investments. It is used by organizations that have adopted SWARM Intelligence, Agile Methodology, and DROID Ops (the latest DevOps and MLOps framework).
<br><br>
Below are the definitions of each section of the DROID Ops Framework
<br>
## GALAXY:
A business galaxy covers an entire industry, defined by a NAICS Code. A galaxy is a vast network of interconnected companies, organizations, and stakeholders that operate in the same industry, offering similar products or services, and competing for the same customers. Just like a real galaxy, the businesses within a particular industry are constantly moving and evolving, with new companies appearing and older ones either consolidating or going out of business.
<br>
## BLACK HOLE:
Large Corporation at the center of a galaxy which slowly consumes all its competitors
The black hole is identified by the largest companies inside the NAICS Code.
At the center of every galaxy is a massive black hole that exerts a powerful gravitational force on everything around it. In the business world, this black hole can be thought of as the largest competitor or holding company in the industry which exerts a powerful influence on its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, competitors, and even the sparks of new ideas in that sector.
<br><br>
## SUPER NOVA:
A Corporate Cosmic-Shifting event
A large event that can be felt across the entire industry.
<br><br>
## SOLAR SYSTEM:
Companies in a business galaxy are organized by their holding companies, known as the Solar System. These solar systems are classified based on their size, market share, and SIC Codes. 
<br><br>
The different solar systems within a galaxy are often interconnected and dependent on each other in various ways. Changes in one part of the galaxy can have significant ripple effects throughout the rest of the industry. This means these companies, organizations, and individuals are interconnected by economic and market forces. All the components of companies, suppliers, customers, and competitors are part of this ecosystem. Each of these components plays a vital role in shaping the overall structure and function of the galaxy.
<br><br>
## SUN:
The largest publicly visible company inside a solar system or the headquarters of an organization.
<br><br>
## SUPER STAR:
A flagship or role model company that could one day become a sun. This could also be a fast growing project that is gaining momentum. Super Stars usually require a vast amount of resources and a large budget, yet they also achieve many objectives.
<br><br>
## STAR:
A small company or project defined by S.T.A.R.s More information included in the S.T.A.R. Guide.
<br><br>
## MOON:
An Orbital, Side Project, Startup, Subsidiary, or department
We define Moons using the O.R.B.I.T.A.L. Framework
<br><br>
## COMET:
Unstable project that needs better planning or avoidance
<br><br>
## ASTEROID:
Same as a comet.
