ORGANIZATIONAL GALAXIES: A COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM
A business galaxy is a vast network of interconnected companies, organizations, and stakeholders that operate in the same industry, offering similar products or services, and competing for the same customers. Just like a real galaxy, the businesses within a particular industry are constantly moving and evolving, with new companies appearing and older ones either consolidating or going out of business.

The different businesses within a galaxy are often interconnected and dependent on each other in various ways. Changes in one part of the galaxy can have significant ripple effects throughout the rest of the industry. This means these companies, organizations, and individuals are interconnected by economic and market forces. All the components of companies, suppliers, customers, and competitors are part of this ecosystem. Each of these components plays a vital role in shaping the overall structure and function of the galaxy.

At the center of every galaxy is a massive black hole that exerts a powerful gravitational force on everything around it. In the business world, this black hole can be thought of as the largest competitor or holding company in the industry which exerts a powerful influence on its subsidiaries, affiliated companies, competitors, and even the sparks of new ideas in that sector.

Companies in a business galaxy can be classified based on their size, market share, and other factors. These classifications can help us understand the structure and dynamics of the galaxy and make informed decisions about our own companies and ideas.

Overall, a business galaxy is a complex and dynamic system that is constantly evolving and changing. By understanding the structure and function of this system, we can better navigate the challenges and opportunities of the industry and position our companies for success.
